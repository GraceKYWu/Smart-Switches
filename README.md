# Smart-Switches
The Flutter App folder contains the code to send request to ESP8266 through WI-Fi network. 
The Prototype ESP8266 folder contains the code to control the ESP8266 using the request from the Flutter App.
To transfer Data from ESP8266 to Arduino, the D1 and D2 pins from the NodeMcu needs to be connected to 
the A4(SDA) and A5(SCL) pins from the Arduino UNO. The code in the TransferDataFromESP8266ToArduino is not used for this system.
The demostration video includes the general setup, user interface and the demonstration of this system.
